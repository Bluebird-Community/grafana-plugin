This will \"unhide\" all queries for each panel.\n  - To convert any Graph panels (these are deprecated in Grafana 9) to the new Grafana Timeseries panel, switch this option on.\n    - This applies only if your dashboard still contains legacy Graph panels that have not yet been migrated to Time Series panels.\n    - This feature may not convert every possible option. You may instead decide to leave this off. In this case, after converting the dashboard, you can go into each panel's options and click the \"Migrate\" button to use the Grafana migration tool to convert the panel to Timeseries.\n  - Click \"Convert\". The converted Dashboard JSON will appear in the Target textbox.\n- Copy the converted JSON.\n- Go into Dashboards > Browse, select New > Import Dashboard and copy the new JSON into the \"Import via panel json\" box and select Load.\n  - You can ignore the \"Change UID\", Grafana will assign a new UID to the new dashboard.\n  - In some cases, you may need to choose an OpenNMS data source.\n  - Click \"Import\" to create and save the new dashboard.\n- Your dashboard should now be displayed.",
