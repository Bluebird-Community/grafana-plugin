= Entities Datasource

You can use the Entities datasource to retrieve entity model objects (alarms and nodes) from OpenNMS.
For an example of the Entities datasource in use, see <<panel_configuration:dynamic-dashboard.adoc#pc-filter-panel, Create a Filter panel>>.

== Datasource queries

This datasource's behavior changes depending on the specified entity.
Attributes and values also change based on the entity type.

NOTE: The datasource allows only a single target.
Subsequent targets in the query editor are ignored.

[[ds-entity-template]]
== Template queries

You can pass a field name to the `attribute` variable to change the behavior of a template query.
This changes the field's display name.
If no `attribute` argument is specified, the query returns the entity's `id` attribute.

The `query` attribute's default value is `alarms()`, meaning it returns a list of alarm IDs.

=== alarms([attribute])

The `alarms()` function queries the OpenNMS alarms REST API.

=== locations()

The `locations()` query returns a list of available node locations.
You can create a variable with a `locations()` query and use that variable inside a `nodeFilter()` query to filter the number of nodes displayed by location.

.Example expressions using `nodeFilter()`
[source,]
----
nodeFilter(location='Default')
nodeFilter(location='$location')
----

=== nodeFilter(<filterQuery>)

The `nodeFilter()` query returns a list of nodes that match the given filter expression.

The filter expression must be made up of an existing node attribute and its corresponding value.
Separate multiple filter expressions with an ampersand (`&`) (for example, `<attribute1>=<value1> & <attribute2>=<value2> & ...`).
The node's value can be a constant or a variable.

.Example expressions using `nodeFilter()`
[source,]
----
nodeFilter(<node_attribute>='<value>')
nodeFilter(location='$location' & label='localhost')
----

For more information about filters, see the https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/reference/configuration/filters/filters.html[OpenNMS Filters documentation].

=== nodes([attribute])

The `nodes()` query retrieves a list of unique values for a specified attribute from the OpenNMS node REST API.
You can use its result in a `nodeFilter()` query to filter nodes either by entity or performance datasource.
To find a list of valid attributes, see your OpenNMS server's `\http://HOSTNAME:8980/opennms/api/v2/nodes/properties` endpoint.

Follow these steps to filter nodes by a custom asset record:

. On your {page-component-title} dashboard, create a variable named `region`, and set its datasource to an entity datasource that points to your server.
. Set the variable's query to `nodes(assetRecord.region)`.
. Click *Save* and return to the list of variables.
. Create a variable named `node`, and set its datasource to a performance datasource.
. Set the variable's query to `nodeFilter(region='$region')`.
. Click *Save* and return to your dashboard.

As you change the `region` variable, the options in the `node` variable should update to show only the matching nodes.
