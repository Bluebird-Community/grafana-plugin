= Flow Datasource

You can use the Flow datasource to retrieve application- and conversation-related metrics derived from OpenNMS flows data.
The query editor supports the following functions:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Function  | Description

2+|*Combine functions*

| topN
| Limit the results to the top _N_ conversations or applications when sorted by total bytes.

| includeOther
| Combine and include other conversations or applications that fall outside of the top _N_.

2+|*Filter functions*

| withExporterNode
| Filter for flows related to the given exporter node.

| withIfIndex
| Filter for flows related to the given interface index.

| withDscp
| Filter for flows with the given DSCP values.

| withApplication
| Filter for flows with the given application values.
Do not use with `topN`.

| withConversation
| Filter for flows with the given conversation values.
Do not use with `topN`.

| withHost
| Filter for flows with the given host values.
Do not use with `topN`.

2+|*Transform functions*

| toBits
| Convert the values from bytes to bits.

| perSecond
| Convert the values to a per-second rate.

| negativeEgress
| Make egress values negative.

| negativeIngress
| Make ingress values negative.

| asTableSummary
| Generate a tabular summary instead of time series data.

| combineIngressEgress
| Combine ingress and egress values.

| onlyIngress
| Display only ingress traffic.

| onlyEgress
| Display only egress traffic.

| withGroupByInterval
| Changes the resolution of the returned datapoints grouping by the given time interval (`10s`, `5m`, `1h`, and so on).

| withPrefix
| Specifies a prefix for graph and summary labels.

| withSuffix
| Specifies a suffix for graph and summary labels.

| nanToZero
| Convert all `NaN` values to zero (`0`) so that reduce expressions (`sum`, `max`) can take them into consideration.

== Template queries

=== locations()

The `locations()` query returns a list of available node locations.
You can create a variable with a `locations()` query and use that variable inside a `exporterNodesWithFlows()` query to filter the number of nodes displayed by location.

.Example expressions
[source,]
----
exporterNodesWithFlows(location='Default')
nodeFilter(location='$location') <1>
----
<1> Assumes that the `$location` variable is populated with a value from a `locations()` query.

=== exporterNodesWithFlows(<filterQuery>)

The `exporterNodesWithFlows()` query returns a list of nodes that have exported flows data to OpenNMS.
The template value is the node's ID, and the display text is the node's label.

NOTE: The specified exporters must be part of your OpenNMS instance's inventory to be returned by this query.

The filter expression must be made up of an existing node attribute and its corresponding value.
Separate multiple expressions with an ampersand (`&`) (for example, `<attribute1>=<value1> & <attribute2>=<value2> & ...`).
The node's value can be a constant, a variable, or a regular expression.

.Example expressions using `exporterNodesWithFlows()`
[source,]
----
exporterNodesWithFlows(<node_attribute>='<value>')
exporterNodesWithFlows(location='Default')
exporterNodesWithFlows(location='$location')
exporterNodesWithFlows(location='$location' & label='localhost')
exporterNodesWithFlows(location='$location' & label='.*com.*')
----

For more information about filters, see the https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/reference/configuration/filters/filters.html[OpenNMS Filters documentation].

=== interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows(<nodeCriteria>)

The `interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows()` query returns a list of interface indexes that are associated with one or more flows on a specified node.
The value of the template variable is the interface's index, and the display text is the interface's name.

Only one argument is available for the `interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows()` query:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Argument  | Description

| nodeCriteria
| Criteria (node ID, or node foreign source and node foreign ID) of the node on which to enumerate interfaces.
|===

.Example expressions using `interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows()`
[source,]
----
interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows($node) <1>
interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows(123) <2>
interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows(FS:FID) <2>
----
<1> Assumes that the `$node` variable is populated with a value from an `exporterNodesWithFlows()` query.
<2> Queries specific nodes using their IDs or `foreignSource:foreignId` tuples.

=== dscpOnExporterNodeAndInterface(<nodeCriteria>,<interface>,<from>,<to>)

The `dscpOnExporterNodeAndInterface()` query returns a list of DSCP values that are used by one or more flows on the specified node and interface during the given time range.
It returns selection options for the DSCP values, and IP precedence groups that cover them.
Their labels are symbolic names for the DSCP codes, followed by the corresponding number (if applicable).

The following arguments are available for the `dscpOnExporterNodeAndInterface()` query:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Argument  | Description

| nodeCriteria
| Criteria (node ID, or node foreign source and node foreign ID) of the node on which to enumerate values.

| interface
| Interface index of the SNMP interface to enumerate.

| from
| Beginning of the time range for which to return values, in epoch milliseconds.

| to
| End of the time range for which to return values, in epoch milliseconds.
|===

.Example expression using `dscpOnExporterNodeAndInterface()`
[source,]
----
dscpOnExporterNodeAndInterface($node, $interface, $__from, $__to) <1>
----
<1> Assumes that the `$node` variable is populated with a value from an `exporterNodesWithFlows()` query, and the `$interface` variable is populated with a value from the `interfacesOnExporterNodeWithFlows($node)` query.

=== applications(<limit>)

The `applications()` query returns a list of all available applications.
This query is intended for use inside the `withApplications()` filter function as a template variable, if necessary.

The query accepts an optional number of records, which ensures that only a limited number of records is retrieved.

NOTE: The application values retrieved come "as is" from the `flows/applications/enumerate` API.

.Example expressions
----
applications(1000)
withApplications($applications) <1>
----
<1> Assumes that the `$applications` variable is populated with a value from an `applications()` query.

=== conversations(<application>,<location>,<protocol>,<limit>)

The `conversations()` query returns a list of all available conversations.
This query is intended for use inside the `withConversation()` filter function as a template variable, if necessary.

NOTE: The conversations values retrieved come "as is" from the `flows/conversations/enumerate` API.

The query accepts the following optional arguments:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Argument  | Description   | Position  | Default Value

| application
| Application expression
| 1
| `.*`

| location
| Location expression
| 2
| `.*`

| protocol
| Protocol expression
| 3
| `.*`

| limit
| Limit for the number of records retrieved.
| Last
| 25

.Example expressions
[source,]
----
conversations(10) <1>
conversations(app0, 10) <2>
conversations(app0, Default, 10) <3>
conversations(app.*, Def.*, http.*, 1000) <4>
withConversation($conversations) <5>
----
<1> Queries all conversations and returns a maximum of 10 records.
<2> Queries all conversations in the `app0` application and the default location, and returns a maximum of 10 records.
<3> Queries all conversations using the `http` protocol in the `app0` application and the default location.
Returns a maximum of 10 records.
<4> Queries all conversations using the `http` and `https` protocols in applications starting with `app`, in locations starting with `Def`.
Returns a maximum of 1,000 records.
<5> Assumes that the `$conversations` variable is populated with a value from a `conversations()` query.

=== hosts(<pattern>,<limit>)

The `hosts()` query returns a list of available hosts.
This query is intended for use inside the `withHost()` filter function as a template variable, if necessary.

NOTE: The host values retrieved come "as is" from the `flows/hosts/enumerate` API.

This query accepts the following optional arguments:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Argument  | Description   | Position  | Default Value

| pattern
| Host expression
| 1
| `.*`

| limit
| Limit for the number of records retrieved.
