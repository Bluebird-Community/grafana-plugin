{page-component-title} works with Grafana Server version *7.0* and up.
It has been tested with Grafana versions up to 7.2 at the time of release.

Note that the Grafana image renderer plugin depends on a project called https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer[Puppeteer] for an embedded headless Chrome/Chromium that has some unrequired dependencies.
See Puppeteer's https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#chrome-headless-doesnt-launch-on-unix[Troubleshooting documentation] for the full dependency list.
