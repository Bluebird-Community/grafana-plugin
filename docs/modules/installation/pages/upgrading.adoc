= Upgrade {product-name}

This section describes how to upgrade your {product-name} installation.
Usually, upgrading simply involves installing the new package.
Major version releases, however, can sometimes introduce breaking changes; in this case, upgrading may be more complex.

Before proceeding, make sure that you have installed the latest version of the {product-name}.
You should also have https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] installed.

== Upgrade datasources

Follow these steps to upgrade your datasources:

. Install https://github.com/grafana-wizzy/wizzy[Wizzy] and create a directory for your datasources:
+
[source, shell]
----
npm i -g wizzy
mkdir /tmp/wizzy
cd /tmp/wizzy
----

. Configure Wizzy to communicate with your Grafana instance:
+
[source, shell]
----
# create a local wizzy project directory
wizzy init
# configure Grafana login information
wizzy set grafana url http://localhost:3000
wizzy set grafana username admin
wizzy set grafana password admin
----

. Export your datasources to the Wizzy project directory:
+
[source, shell]
wizzy import datasources

. Convert any `fault` datasources to `entity`:
+
[source, shell]
perl -pi -e 's/opennms-grafana-plugin-fault-datasource/opennms-grafana-plugin-entity-datasource/g' datasources/*.json

. Publish your changes to your Grafana instance:
+
[source, shell]
wizzy export datasources

== Upgrade dashboards

When you upgrade your {product-name} to version 9, any previously existing dashboards must be upgraded.
If they are not upgraded, they will not be displayed.

{product-name} version 9.x includes a dashboard conversion tool to upgrade dashboards created in version 8.x and lower.
To use the tool, you need to export your dashboards from the previous version of the plugin.
Exporting dashboards produces a JSON file containing their settings and associated data.

After you export your old dashboards, upgrade your plugin to version 9.x.
Next, use the conversion tool to update your dashboards:

. xref:getting_started:basic_walkthrough.adoc#bw-dashboard-create[Create a new dashboard].
. Click the *Add Panel* symbol.
. Click *Add New Panel*.
. Select the *Dashboard Convert* panel.

.Dashboard Convert panel

. On the Dashboard Convert panel, select the version of the plugin from which you exported the dashboard using the *Source Plugin Version* list.
. Paste the contents of a dashboard JSON file in the *Source Dashboard JSON* box.
The dashboard's name should appear in the *Dashboard Title* box.
** (Optional) Edit the *Dashboard Title*.
** (Optional) Toggle *Unhide All Queries* on or off, as desired.
Toggling this on marks all OpenNMS datasource queries as visible, which may be useful for troubleshooting.
. Click *Convert*.
The converted JSON is displayed in the *Target Dashboard JSON* box.
. Copy the converted JSON and use it to import a dashboard.
