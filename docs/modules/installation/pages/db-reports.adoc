= Configuration for PDF dashboard reports

OpenNMS Horizon/Meridian includes three templates to create a PDF report from an existing Grafana dashboard. 
If you plan to use this feature and are using a Docker image for Grafana, you must complete additional configuration.

Refer to Grafana's https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/image_rendering/#remote-rendering-service[Remote rendering service documentation] for more information on how to set up remote rendering. 
Additional details are available on https://github.com/grafana/grafana-image-renderer/blob/master/docs/remote_rendering_using_docker.md[GitHub].
