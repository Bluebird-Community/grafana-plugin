* *Critical:* Numerous devices are impacted by an event.
* *Major:* A device is down, or in danger of going down.
* *Minor:* A part of a device (service, interface, power supply, and so on) has stopped functioning.
* *Warning:* An event has occurred that may require action.
* *Normal:* Informational severity message; no action is required.
* *Cleared:* Indicates that an alarm with a self-clearing error condition has been corrected, and service is restored.
* *Indeterminate:* No severity could be associated with the event.
