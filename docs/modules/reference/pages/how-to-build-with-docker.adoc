= Build from Source with Docker

This section describes how to build the {page-component-title} with Docker.

== Simple build

You can compile the plugin from source with a Docker build image:

. Check out the repository, compile the code, and install the plugin:
+
[source, shell]
docker build -t mygrafanapluginimage .

. Run the image:
+
[source, shell]
docker run -p 3000:3000 -t mygrafanapluginimage

. Log in to your Grafana instance with the default admin credentials (`admin`/`admin`).
. Navigate to *Plugins* and enable the *OpenNMS Plugin for Grafana*.

IMPORTANT: The Grafana plugin directory location is changed from `/var/lib/grafana/plugins` to `/opt/grafana/plugins`.
This is because the base Grafana image defines `/var/lib/grafana` as a volume, which cannot be changed.

== Advanced build

If you want to build the {page-component-title} based on a specific GitHub fork or branch, you can use `--build-arg`:

[source, shell]
----
docker build -t mycustomforkbranch \
            --build-arg OPENNMS_GRAFANA_PLUGIN_GIT_URL=https://github.com/OpenNMS/grafana-plugin.git \
            --build-arg OPENNMS_GRAFANA_PLUGIN_GIT_BRANCH_REF=myBranch
----

This creates the plugin based on the GitHub URL and branch that you provide.

== Build service stack with Docker Compose

The plugin package includes an example `docker-compose.yml`, which builds a service stack with a compiled {page-component-title} that you can test.
You can modify the build arguments in the file if you want to build from a specific GitHub fork, branch, or version tag.

When you first run `docker-compose up -d`, the plugin is compiled from the source.
Subsequent runs will use the compiled image from your local system.
If you want to rebuild the image, run `docker-compose build --no-cache`.

The URL for your Horizon or Meridian datasource is `\http://opennms:8980/opennms`.

== Configure Docker for PDF reports

Horizon and Meridian include templates from which you can create PDF reports.
They use an existing Grafana dashboard (see https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/operation/deep-dive/database-reports/templates/grafana.html[Grafana Dashboard] in the main OpenNMS documentation).
If you want to use this feature, and you are running the {page-component-title} through Docker, you must complete additional configuration.
Refer to Grafana's https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/image_rendering/#remote-rendering-service[remote rendering service documentation] for more information.
