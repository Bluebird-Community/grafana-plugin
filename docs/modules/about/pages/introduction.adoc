= About {page-component-title}

{page-component-title} is an application that lets you create flexible dashboards to visualize and interact with data stored by OpenNMS.
It works with https://grafana.com[Grafana] to customize and display <<fault, fault management>> and <<performance, performance management>> data from OpenNMS https://www.opennms.org[Horizon] and https://www.opennms.com[Meridian].

You can create and customize dashboards to display the data that you want to see--alarms, outages, key performance indicators--in a way that best meets your needs.

== How does it work?

{page-component-title} includes datasources for retrieving both fault management and performance management data from an existing OpenNMS instance.
It also includes specialized panels that let you display and interact with the data.
Because you can aggregate data from multiple OpenNMS instances, you can use {page-component-title} to create a single view that encompasses your distributed deployments.

All interactions between {page-component-title} and OpenNMS are done via the https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/latest/development/rest/rest-api.html[REST API].
No fault management or performance management data is stored within {page-component-title} or Grafana.

[[fault]]
== Fault management

Fault management is the process of identifying problems related to network devices and systems, and managing their lifecycle.
OpenNMS uses a combination of events, outages, alarms, and notifications to do this.
{page-component-title} supports filtering, retrieving, displaying, and performing actions against alarms that OpenNMS generates.

TIP: If you are not familiar with alarms in OpenNMS, you can learn more from https://youtu.be/06mLvyGQCkg[OpenNMS 101 - Module 5: Alarms on YouTube].

[[performance]]
== Performance management

Performance management is the process of gathering, storing, and analyzing system health using a series of metrics.
You can use these metrics for historical analysis, or to automatically generate faults when certain conditions or thresholds are met.
{page-component-title} can retrieve and visualize metric data that OpenNMS stores.
