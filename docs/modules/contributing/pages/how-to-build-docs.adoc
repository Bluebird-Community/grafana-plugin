= Write and Build Documentation

If you want to contribute documentation to this project which manages the docs with Antora, you’ve come to the right place.

== Install Antora

Antora is a documenation site generator based around the AsciiDoc format. 
To install Antora, follow the https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/install/install-antora/[instructions] on the Antora website.  

== Make a copy of the OpenNMS docs repo

If you already know how to use https://git-scm.com/[git], then this is going to sound very familiar.
If not, here’s the full walk-through:

1. Install git.
2. If the docs source is hosted on GitHub, you will need to https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork] the https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-helm[OpenNMS Helm repo].
3. Using git, clone the repo (either the original or your fork, as appropriate) to your local system: `git clone <repo URL>`

If the project that you are working in already has version branches, you should set up local copies of those as well.
After you have cloned the repo to your local system, you can track those branches:

[source, shell]
----
$ git checkout -b <local_branch_name> <remote_repo>/<remote_branch_name>
----

== Write the docs

The documentation for the project lives in the `docs` directory within the source code repository you have checked out.
Each main section is structured in directories and contains the text .adoc files.
Write the text files in the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc] format.

You must include every new created directory or text file in the general structure of the documentation.
The nav.adoc file in the ROOT direcory defines the content hierarchy.

.Structure of the nav.adoc file
[source]
----

.About  <1>
* xref:about:welcome.adoc[Welcome] <2>
* xref:about:legal_notice.adoc[Legal Notice]  <2>

.Installation  <3>
* xref:installation:requirements.adoc[Requirements]  <4>
* xref:installation:rpm.adoc[Installing on RPM-based Linux (CentOS, Fedora, OpenSuse, RedHat)]  <4>
* xref:installation:debian.adoc[Installing on Debian/Ubuntu]  <4>
----
<1> Friendly directory name "About" that appears in the left navigation.
<2> Each topic in the "About" section, written as a cross reference to the directory, file name, and friendly name that appears in the left navigation. 
<3> Second section "Installation".
<4> Each topic in the "Installation" section. 

Include images in the `assests/images` directory inside each module folder.
Include images in the text file as follows:

[source]
----
// At the beginning of the .adoc text file
:imagesdir: ./images  <1>

.Overview of the structure of Helm  <2>
image::helm-diagram.svg[Helm Diagram, 600]  <3>
----

<1> Lookup directory for images for this text file.
<2> Description of the image.
<3> Include the image with alternative text and a proportional width of 600 pixels.

The `_distro_map.yml` controls how docs are generated for different branches and distributions.
It is normally not necessary to touch this file when just creating or changing existing content.
The file is described as the following:

[source]
----
---
helm: <1>
  name: Helm
  author: OpenNMS Docs Team <opennms-docs@lists.sourceforge.net>
  site: opennms <2>
  site_name: OpenNMS
  site_url: https://docs.opennms.org/helm
  branches:
    master: <3>
      name: Latest <4>
      dir: latest <5>

----
<1> System name of distro. 
Used when conditionalizing content on a per-distro basis.
<2> System name of site. 
Used to pick up the correct index file and organize the included distros.
<3> Git branch name that represents a version of this distro.
<4> User-readable name of this version of this distro.
<5> Directory on the site where this version of this distro should go.

== Building the docs

The documentation is located in the `docs` directory.
Transforming an Antora repo into a documentation site is pretty easy:

[source, shell]
----
antora generate local-site.yml
----

=== Build output

Antora creates a .zip file of the documentation site in the `build` directory. 
Unzip the file to reveal the HTML content in the `site` directory. 

The generic path to a given version of the docs is:

[source, shell]
----
<docs_repo_dir>/build/site/<distro>/<branch_dir_name>
----
