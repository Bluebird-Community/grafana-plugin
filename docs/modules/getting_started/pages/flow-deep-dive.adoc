= Flow Deep-Dive Dashboard

The {page-component-title} includes a predesigned flow deep-dive dashboard that visualizes flow data.
You can access this dashboard from your Grafana home page, or from the menu:Dashboards[Manage] page.

The dashboard can help with quality of service monitoring, and includes panels that display the following data categories:

* Flow interface statistics (throughput and data use by application)
* SNMP interface statistics (interface throughput and errors/discards)
* Conversations (throughput and data use by conversation)
* Hosts (throughput and data use by host)
* DCSPs (throughput and data use by Differentiated Services Code Points)

== Quality of service monitoring options

The flow deep-dive dashboard exposes nodes and interfaces with flows that you can filter on in the *Node* and *Interface* lists.
You can also filter flows traffic by the type of service and differentiated services code point (DSCP) for nodes and interfaces with these values.

To customize the displayed data, select a DSCP value (or combination of values) from the list for the quality of service metric that you want to visualize (for example, class selector or IP precedence).

The ECN (explicit congestion notification) column in summary tables shows ECN-related information, separated by a forward slash (`/`).
The first value indicates if all summarized flows use ECN-capable transports (abbreviated by `ect`), or at least one flow used `non-ect`.
The second value indicates if a congestion was encountered (`ce`) or no congestion was encountered (`no ce`).
This works for both aggregated and unaggregated flow data.

== Configuration

By default, the flow deep-dive dashboard uses the OpenNMS xref:datasources:flow_datasource.adoc[flow] and xref:datasources:performance_datasource.adoc[performance] datasources.
If you have not already specified these datasources, see <<basic_walkthrough.adoc#bw-ds-setup, Create a datasource>>.

You can further configure the dashboard by creating queries or editing existing panels.
For more information, see xref:panel_configuration:index.adoc[].

IMPORTANT: Use *Save As* to save your customized version of the flow deep-dive dashboard.
Otherwise, changes that you make to the default dashboard will be overwritten when you update the plugin or reimport the dashboard.
