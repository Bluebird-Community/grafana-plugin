= Get Started

To use all of the features that the {page-component-title} offers, you should be familiar with both OpenNMS and Grafana.
In-depth documentation about both is beyond the scope of this guide; however, the following materials can serve as a primer:

* https://youtu.be/GJzmkshdjiI?list=PLsXgBGH3nG7iZSlssmZB3xWsAJlst2j2z[OpenNMS 101 training videos].
* https://grafana.com/docs/[Grafana documentation].
* https://docs.huihoo.com/grafana/2.6/guides/screencasts/index.html[Grafana screencasts].

TIP: Consider taking the time to decide what information you want to include in your dashboard and how you want to organize it.

After you familiarize yourself with OpenNMS and Grafana, you can get started with the plugin.
