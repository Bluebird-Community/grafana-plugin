= Migrate From OpenNMS Data Source Plugin

This section describes how to migrate an existing installation of Grafana that uses the OpenNMS Data Source plugin to {page-component-title}.

IMPORTANT: This section applies only to those still using the OpenNMS Data Source plugin, which was deprecated in 2016.

To complete this migration, you must have the following:

* An instance of Grafana with the OpenNMS Data Source plugin installed.
* A configured OpenNMS datasource.
* One or more dashboards using the OpenNMS datasource.

== Install the plugin

Before completing the migration, ensure that you have xref:installation:requirements.adoc[installed the plugin] on your Grafana instance.

NOTE: Both the OpenNMS Data Source plugin and {page-component-title} can be installed on your Grafana instance while you complete the migration.

== Grafana setup

After you have installed the {page-component-title}, you must enable it in Grafana to make the provided panels and datasources available:

. Navigate to the home page of your Grafana instance.
. In the left navigation menu, click menu:Configuration[Plugins]:
+
image::gf-plugins.png["Grafana menu displaying navigation options. The Plugins option is highlighted.", 250]

. Select the *OpenNMS Helm* plugin.
** If the plugin is not listed, try restarting your Grafana instance.
** If the issue persists, make sure the plugin is in the Grafana plugins directory (default: `var/lib/grafana/plugins`).
. Click menu:Config[Enable].
+
NOTE: The Disable option indicates that the OpenNMS Helm plugin is already enabled.
You can also choose *Update* to download the latest version of the plugin.

== Migrate datasources

After you enable the plugin, you can convert your existing datasources to use the OpenNMS Performance type.
Note that when switching the type, you may need to re-enter the datasource's URL and authentication details.

The plugin provides two datasource types; the OpenNMS Performance type is equivalent to the previous "OpenNMS" datasource.

== Verify dashboards

After you have converted your datasources, we recommend that you ensure your existing dashboards render properly.
If you encounter any errors during the migration, you can revert to the previous datasource type.

== Remove OpenNMS Data Source plugin

Finally, if your dashboards continue to work with the new datasource type, you can remove the OpenNMS Data Source plugin.
Use the `grafana-cli` tool to remove it:

[source, console]
sudo grafana-cli plugins remove opennms-datasource

Restart Grafana to completely unregister the plugin:

[source, console]
sudo service grafana-server restart
