= Create a Dashboard

This section demonstrates how to create a simple dashboard in {page-component-title}.

You must have the following pre-requisites to create a dashboard:

* An instance of Grafana with the {page-component-title} plugin installed.
* An instance of OpenNMS that is reachable from your Grafana instance.
* One or more nodes being monitored by OpenNMS.

If you already use the OpenNMS Data Source plugin with Grafana, see xref:migrating_from_opennms_datasource.adoc[] for information on how to switch to {page-component-title}.

== Set up {page-component-title}

First, you must enable the {page-component-title} plugin in Grafana and <<custom-actions, create custom actions>> to help with alarm diagnosis:

. Navigate to the home page of your Grafana instance.
. In the left navigation menu, select menu:Configuration[Plugins]:
+
image::gf-plugins.png["Grafana menu displaying navigation options. The Plugins option is highlighted.", 250]

. Select the *OpenNMS Helm* plugin.
** If the plugin is not listed, try restarting your Grafana server.
** If the issue persists, make sure the plugin is in the Grafana plugins directory (default: `var/lib/grafana/plugins`).
. Click menu:Config[Enable].
+
NOTE: The Disable option indicates that the OpenNMS Helm plugin is already enabled.
You can also choose *Update* to download the latest version of the plugin.

[[custom-actions]]
=== Create custom actions

A custom action is a user-defined operation (for example, a link to a node detail page or a knowledge base article) that might help users diagnose an alarm.
Once created, custom actions are displayed when you right-click an alarm in an alarms table:

image::gf-cust-action-context.png["Alarms table with three alarms. The context menu is displayed, listing three custom actions.", 500]

You can create a custom action on the Helm Config page.
Each custom action includes a label and a URL; the URL may contain `$variables` that reference OpenNMS alarm properties.
Note that variables are URL-encoded when injected into a URL.
See the https://docs.opennms.com/opennms-js/latest/index.html[OpenNMS.js documentation] for a list of available properties.

NOTE: As a special case, you can access an alarm's event parameters either by index (`$parameters[1]`) or by name (`$parameters[reason]`).

If a variable cannot be matched against the appropriate row, the action does not appear in the context menu.

.Sample custom action URLs with parameters
image::gf-custom-actions.png["Two examples of custom action URLs with embedded variables.", 500]

To create a custom action, follow these steps:

. Navigate to the home page of your Grafana instance.
. In the left navigation menu, select menu:Configuration[Plugins].
. Select *OpenNMS Helm*.
. On the Config tab, click *Add Custom Action*.
. Specify a label and enter a URL.
** In most cases, the URL should point to your OpenNMS instance (for example, `\http://localhost:8980/opennms/`, appended with a `$variable` that references an alarm property).
. Click *Update*.

The action should be displayed in the context menu when you right-click an entry in an alarms table.

[[bw-ds-setup]]
== Create a datasource

The type of data that you can display in a dashboard depends on the datasource that you select.

Before you create a dashboard, you must set up the datasource (either xref:datasources:performance_datasource.adoc[performance], xref:datasources:flow_datasource.adoc[flow], or xref:datasources:entity_datasource.adoc[entity]).
For this walk-through, we will configure the entity datasource.
Note, however, that you can follow the same process to configure a flow or performance datasource.

You need to configure only the *URL*, *Basic Auth*, and *Basic Auth Details* (username and password) fields.
See the https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/[official Grafana documentation] for information on configuring other fields.

Follow these steps to set up a datasource:

. Navigate to the home page of your Grafana instance.
. In the left navigation menu, select menu:Configuration[Data Sources]:
+
image::gf-data-sources.png["Grafana menu displaying navigation options. The Data Sources option is highlighted.", 250]

. Select *Add Data Source*.
. In the *Search* box, type *OpenNMS Entities*.
. Select the *OpenNMS Entities* datasource.
The settings dialog is displayed:
+
image::gf-data-config.png["OpenNMS Entities datasource settings dialog displaying sample settings.", 500]

. Type the *URL* that directs to your OpenNMS instance (for example, `\http://localhost:8980/opennms`).
In most cases, this URL should end with `/opennms`.
. Under Auth, toggle *Basic Auth* on.
. Enter the credentials for an OpenNMS user in the *User* and *Password* boxes.
. Click *Save & Test*.
A success message should be displayed.
** If the message indicates a failure, review the information that you entered and click *Save & Test* to retest the settings.

== Create a dashboard

For this walk-through, we will create a dashboard with an alarms table.
For information on displaying other data in a dashboard, see <<bw-panel-create, Create a panel>>.

. In the left navigation menu, click the *plus* symbol (*+*), and choose *Dashboard*.
. Click menu:Add Panel[Add an Empty Panel].
. Configure its settings in the lower half of the page:
+
image::gf-panel-config.png["An example dashboard displaying its configuration settings. The settings are highlighted with a green box."]

. Select the datasource that you created in <<bw-ds-setup, Create a datasource>> from the *Query* list.
. In the *Select* list, choose *Alarms*.
** (Optional) Configure additional information and add filters.
** (Optional) Click *+ Query* to add a query to the dashboard.
. Under Panel Options, type the dashboard's name in the *Title* box.
. Under Visualization, select *Alarm Table*.
** (Optional) Customize the graph by specifying settings under Panel Options.
. Click the *Save* symbol at the top-right of the dashboard.
. Type a name for the dashboard, and click *Save*.

Your dashboard should now be displayed.
To test it, you can change the time range at the top-right of the page, or right-click an alarm to perform custom actions against it.

You can create more panels to display other data, or xref:importing.adoc[import an existing dashboard] for design examples.

[[bw-panel-create]]
== Create a panel

A panel is a component of a dashboard; it displays your specified fault and performance management data.

Before you add a panel to your dashboard, determine the type of data that you want to visualize (performance, metrics, alarms or nodes, and so on), and make sure that you have <<bw-ds-setup, set up a datasource>>.
Default graph types in Grafana work only with their appropriate datasource (for example, an alarm table visualization will not display data if a flow datasource is specified).

{page-component-title} includes the following custom panels:

* Alarm histogram
* Alarm table
* Filter panel
* Flow histogram

For more information about custom panel types, see xref:panel_configuration:index.adoc#custom-panel[Default custom panels].

Follow the steps below to create a new panel in your existing dashboard:

. Navigate to your dashboard and click the *Add Panel* symbol.
. Click *Add New Panel*.
. Select a datasource from the *Query* list.
** (Optional) Configure additional settings.
Options are dependent on the type of datasource selected.
. Navigate to the *Panel* tab.
. Under Visualization, click the *Visualization* symbol.
. Click *Graph*.
The graph is displayed at the top of the panel.
** (Optional) Configure settings in the bottom half of the panel to customize the graph.
. Specify the panel's *Name*.
. Click *Save* at the top-right of the panel.

=== Create an alarm panel

An alarm panel displays alarms from an xref:datasources:entity_datasource.adoc[entities datasource].
Normally, visualization of the information in an entities datasource is done with tables.

Follow these steps to create a new alarm panel in your existing dashboard:

. Navigate to your dashboard and click the *Add Panel* symbol.
. Click *Add New Panel*.
. Select an entity datasource from the *Query* list.
. Choose *Alarms* from the *Select* list.
. Set filters and conditions to specify the nodes and alarms to visualize.
** Note that you can use nested "and/or" logic for the filters and conditions.
** You can order alarms by ascending (oldest alarms first) or descending (most recent alarms first).
** You can limit the number of alarms displayed.
** You can toggle *Featured Attributes* on to display select attributes.
Toggle it off to display all attributes in the drop-down lists.
+
image::gf-alarm-table.png["Example settings for a new alarm table panel."]

. Navigate to the *Panel* tab.
. Under Visualization, click the *Visualization* symbol.
. Select *Alarm Table*.
The graph is displayed at the top of the panel.
+
NOTE: You can choose a table or a histogram graph for alarms.
For nodes, you can configure only a table graph.

** (Optional) Configure the settings in the bottom half of the panel to customize the graph.
. Update the panel's *Name*.
. Click *Save* at the top-right of the panel.
