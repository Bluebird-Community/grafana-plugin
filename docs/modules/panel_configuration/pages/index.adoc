= Panel Configuration

{page-component-title} allows for robust customization of dashboard panels, from updating their appearance and general information to configuring complex filters.
You can configure a panel by interacting with its options in editing mode:

Configuration options depend on the type of datasource associated with a panel.

This section describes the following types of panel configuration:

* xref:forecasting.adoc[Forecast metrics].
* xref:dynamic-dashboard.adoc[Dynamic dashboards].
* xref:expressions.adoc[Working with expressions].

== Default custom panels

{page-component-title} comes with several pre-configured custom panels:

* *Alarm Histogram:* A bar chart that shows the distribution of alarms by severity level.
+
image::alarm-histogram.png["Horizontal bar graph showing the distribution of critical and major alarms", 750]

* *Alarm Table:* A table that displays alarms.
The query for this panel must include an `asTableSummary()` transform, otherwise it will not display any data.
+

* *Filter Panel:* A panel that lets you specify data to include in other panels.

* *Flow Histogram:* A bar chart that shows the distribution of flows data.
The query for this panel must include an `asTableSummary()` transform, otherwise it will not display any data.

For a panel to display data visualizations, you must define the following settings:

* Flow Type
* Datasource
* Time Interval

== Functions and transformations

Each {page-component-title} datasource has functions and transformations associated with it.
Functions let you perform actions based on the data transmitted by the datasource.
Transformations are functions that let you convert data or choose to display only certain types of information (for example, only ingress or egress traffic).

For more information and lists of specific functions, see the xref:datasources:performance_datasource.adoc[Datasources] section.
