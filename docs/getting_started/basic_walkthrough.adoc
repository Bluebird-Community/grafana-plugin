== Overview

This guide demonstrates how to create a simple dashboard with {product-title} by doing the following:

* xref:bw-app-setup[setting up the application and custom actions]
* xref:bw-ds-setup[setting up datasources]
* xref:bw-dash-setup[creating a dashboard]
* xref:bw-panel-setup[creating a panel]


The tutorial assumes that you have:

* an instance of Grafana with the {product-title} application installed
* an instance of OpenNMS that is reachable from the Grafana instance above
* one or mode nodes being monitored by OpenNMS

[NOTE]
====
If you are already using the OpenNMS Data Source plugin with Grafana, see xref:migrating_from_opennms_datasource.adoc#[Migrating from the OpenNMS Data Source plugin] to migrate to using {product-title} to interface with OpenNMS.

[[bw-app-setup]]
== Application Setup

In this section, you will enable the {product-title} application in Grafana and create <<Custom Actions>>.

. Navigate to the http://127.0.0.1:3000/[home page] of your Grafana instance.
. In the left menu, click on the Configuration icon, and click *Plugins*:
+

. Search for the `OpenNMS Helm` application and click on it.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the `OpenNMS Helm` application is not listed on the `Plugins` tab, try restarting the Grafana server.
If the issue persists, make sure the application is installed correctly.
====

. Enable the application by clicking on the `Enable` button.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you see a `Disable` button, then the application is already enabled and you can skip to the next step. You may also choose `Update` for the latest version of {product-title}. 
====

=== Custom Actions

In the Helm Config tab, you can add custom actions. 
These will (currently) show when you right-click an alarm in an alarm table.

A custom action is ... such as linking a parameter or viewing an alarm link.
Custom action URLs may contain `$variables` that reference properties of an OpenNMS alarm.
See http://docs.opennms.org/opennms-js/branches/master/opennms-js/classes/onmsalarm.html[OpenNMS.js documentation] for a list of the available properties.


[NOTE]
====
Special case: event parameters on the alarm can be accessed either by index (`$parameters[1]`) or by name (`$parameters[reason]`).
====

If a variable can't be matched against the row, the action will not appear in the context menu.

Variables will be URL-encoded when they are injected into the URL.

.Create action URLs using parameters.

== Data Source Setup

In this section, you will configure the _Entities_ data source.

+
image::gf-data-sources.png[Data Sources, 100]

. Next, click on `Add data source`.

. In the *Name* field enter: `My First OpenNMS DS`.

. Change the *Type* to `OpenNMS Entities`.

. In the *Url* field enter the URL to your OpenNMS instance, i.e., `http://localhost:8980/opennms`.
+
[NOTE]
====
The URL to your OpenNMS instance should normally end with `/opennms`.
====

. Click the checkbox next to *Basic Auth*.

. Enter the credentials for an OpenNMS user in the *User* and *Password* fields.

. Click the *Add* button.

If the data source is configured correctly you should see a message indicating that the `Data source is working`.
If the message indicates a failure, review the information that was entered and click *Save & Test* to test the data source again.

[[bw-dash-setup]]

. Return to the dashboard view by clicking `Back to dashboard` near the top of the screen.

. Save the dashboard by clicking the disk icon near the top of the screen, enter a name, and click `Save`.

That's it! Now, you have your first dashboard.
Try changing the time range at the top right of the screen, or try performing actions against the alarms by right clicking on any of the alarm rows.
